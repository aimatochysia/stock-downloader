### App made wth Python's Tkinter to download latest data of Indonesian Stock Screener from this repo:
[stock-results](https://github.com/aimatochysia/stock-results)
### Which is automatically created via github action of this repo: 
[stock-analyzer](https://github.com/aimatochysia/stock-analyzer)

This project is a stock result downloader application built in Python, which allows users to download stock screener results based on the Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicator. The tool fetches stock data and generates a CSV file containing the stock results based on the last day's data, providing an easy way for users to analyze stocks based on this indicator.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: Deprecated

The current version of the **Stock Downloader** is **deprecated**. The application will no longer be maintained or updated. We are transitioning to a new, web-based solution, which will replace the `.exe` file downloader. The new system will offer better flexibility, accessibility, and ease of use, removing the need for downloading and installing any software.

### üìâ Current Features (Deprecated)

- **SMA-Based Stock Screening**: Filters stocks based on the Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the last day's data.
- **CSV Downloader**: Downloads the stock screener results as a CSV file for further analysis.
- **Standalone `.exe` Application**: Built using Python and converted into an `.exe` file for ease of use without needing to install dependencies.
- **Last Day's Data**: Uses the stock data of the previous day for screening, not real-time data.

### üîß Technologies Used (Deprecated)

- **Python**: The primary programming language used to build the stock downloader.
- **PyInstaller**: Used to convert the Python script into an executable (`.exe`) file.
- **Pandas**: For handling stock data and generating CSV files.
- **Yahoo Finance API**: For fetching stock data based on SMA for the last day's result.
- **Matplotlib (optional)**: For any potential visualizations (if included).

### üöß What's Next?

The current `.exe` version is being replaced by a **web-based solution**. The new web-based version will:
- Offer access to stock screener results through a modern web interface.
- No longer require downloading or installing any software.
- Provide dynamic filtering and better user experience.
- Allow users to fetch and analyze stock data easily via the web.
